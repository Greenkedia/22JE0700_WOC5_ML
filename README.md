# WOC 5.0 ML Bootcamp
This repository has codes in which linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, KNN for classification and a 1-layer neural network for classification.
The google colab files can be opened to view the outputs that were obtained when I had executed them. The codes can also be executed again to to  see how they work. One can also change the hyperparameters to see how the code acts.
The pieces of codes should be executed in the same order as they appear to get the correct output.
